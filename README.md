This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in JavaScript: type coercion. The `foo` function showcases this issue where adding a number and a string results in string concatenation rather than numerical addition.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a fix for this, demonstrating how to explicitly handle types to prevent unexpected behavior. This example highlights the importance of type checking and explicit type conversion in JavaScript to avoid subtle and hard-to-detect errors.
